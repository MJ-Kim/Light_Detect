# Light_Detect
University &amp; Industry cowork project (Team VAR &amp; Alchera Inc.)
Estimate the light source from a single image.

Our project is divided into Client(HoloLens), Server(PC), and Machine Learning(Neural Network Model, Inference) parts.
- Part1. Client: https://github.com/sshan10/AR_Rendering
- Part2. Server: https://github.com/yuriver/ServerForHololens
- Part3. ML: https://github.com/MJ-Kim/Light_Detect/
